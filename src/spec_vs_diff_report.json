  "summary": "The diff implements improved frontend error handling for lead submission (including normalized user messages, raw error details, and structured console logging), adds a lightweight backend connectivity check with a non-blocking warning banner, and introduces a new frontend actor/config module intended to support correct anonymous actor configuration. One unrelated utility change (URL secret parameter extraction) appears to be added outside the stated scope.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/modified utility to extract “secret parameters” from the URL query string for admin token initialization.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is focused on fixing lead form submission errors, anonymous actor configuration, and adding a backend connectivity check. Secret/admin token URL parameter handling is not requested and appears to be a separate feature area.",
