      "requirement": "Replace the app’s static QR asset with the user-uploaded image `image-5.png` at `frontend/public/assets/generated/payment-qr.dim_512x512.png`, ensuring it is served at runtime from `/assets/generated/payment-qr.dim_512x512.png`.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to `frontend/public/assets/generated/payment-qr.dim_512x512.png` (or any `frontend/public` asset) in the provided diff; only `project_state.json` was modified, so the QR image cannot have been replaced or ensured to ship in production.",
